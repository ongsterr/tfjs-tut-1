## **Tensorflow Learning Journey - Exercise #1**

---

This is my first attempt at Tensorflow.js and revising some of the machine learning and deep learning concepts I studied before.
This exercise takes data on horsepower and miles per gallon to train a model to predict miles per gallon given horsepower.
